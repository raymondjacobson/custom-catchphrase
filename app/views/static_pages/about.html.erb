<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>Custom Catch-Phrase is a catch phrase clone that lets you input your own words. Daniela Fishbein, one of my friends, is interning this summer at a non-profit in Columbia Heights, D.C. called CARECEN (<a href="www.carecendc.org/">www.carecendc.org</a>) to help the D.C. area Latino population gain U.S. citizenship. She’s tutoring clients to help them pass their citizenship tests. She thought it’d be very useful to have a customizable catch-phrase game to help make teaching about people like Thomas Jefferson more fun and interactive!</p>
