<h2>About this project</h2>
<p>We are creating a catch phrase game clone that lets you input your own words. Daniela Fishbein, one of my friends, is interning this summer at a non-profit in Columbia Heights, D.C. called CARECEN (<a href="www.carecendc.org/">www.carecendc.org</a>) to help the D.C. area Latino population gain U.S. citizenship. She’s tutoring clients to help them pass their citizenship tests. She thought it’d be very useful to have a customizable catch-phrase game to help make teaching about people like Thomas Jefferson more fun and interactive!</p>

<p>Feel free to help Daniela and CARECEN out with a donation <a href="www.active.com/donations/fundraise_public.cfm?ckey=CARECEN&key=daniela&force_a2=y">here.</a></p>

<p>Tech: Ruby on Rails, Twitter Bootstrap, SASS, JavaScript/CoffeeScript</p>
<p>This is an open-source project so visit the <a href="https://github.com/raymondjacobson/custom-catchphrase">repo</a> to fork and/or contribute to a great cause.</p>
